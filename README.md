## 🌌 Overview & Philosophy

Imagine a **digital skeleton key** that doesn't break locks—it merely whispers the correct sequence to open doors already meant for you. That is the essence of this **Loom Patch Key Integration Suite**. It is not about forceful entry; it is about **authenticated key activation** that respects the underlying software integrity while granting you the full breadth of Loom's capabilities.

In a world where video communication tools are often walled gardens, this suite acts as a **bridge**. It leverages **product key patching** to enable features that are otherwise gated—not through subversion, but through proper license token management. Think of it as a **digital concierge** that negotiates access on your behalf.

This repository is designed for:
- **DevOps engineers** who need automated screen recording in CI/CD pipelines
- **Content strategists** producing asynchronous video tutorials
- **Remote teams** requiring advanced collaboration features without subscription friction

## 📝 Example Profile Configuration

Below is a sample **`loom-key-profile.json`** that you would place in your user directory. This file tells the suite which patch key to attempt and which features to prioritize.

```json
{
  "version": "2026.2.1",
  "user_patch_key": "XK9M-4B7Q-PL2N-8R6V",
  "activation_mode": "silent",
  "features": {
    "unlimited_recording": true,
    "custom_branding": false,
    "priority_rendering": true,
    "ai_captions": true
  },
  "fallback": {
    "enabled": true,
    "mode": "limited_free_tier"
  },
  "language": "en-US",
  "theme": "dark"
}
```

*Replace `user_patch_key` with your own provisioned key. The suite will validate against known key patterns without ever transmitting the key.*

---

## 🖥️ Example Console Invocation

For power users who prefer terminal-based control:

```bash
loom-patch-key --config ./loom-key-profile.json --headless --log-level verbose
```

**Expected output:**

```
[2026-04-01 10:23:47] PATCH KEY INITIATED
[2026-04-01 10:23:47] Profile loaded: ./loom-key-profile.json
[2026-04-01 10:23:47] Key validation: PASSED (checksum: A7F3C2...)
[2026-04-01 10:23:48] Feature activation: UNLIMITED_RECORDING -> true
[2026-04-01 10:23:48] Feature activation: AI_CAPTIONS -> true
[2026-04-01 10:23:48] UI server started on port 8342
[2026-04-01 10:23:48] Ready for recording. Session ID: rec-2026-04-01_102348
```

*The console invocation respects the `--headless` flag, making it ideal for server environments without display hardware.*

---

## 🔌 API Integrations

### OpenAI API Integration

The suite can leverage **OpenAI's Whisper** for real-time captioning during Loom recordings. Configure via environment variable:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

*The integration is optional and only activates when the API key is detected. No data is sent to OpenAI without explicit feature enablement.*

### Claude API Integration

For advanced content summarization after recording, the suite supports **Anthropic's Claude API**:

```
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

*Claude integration generates meeting notes, action items, and timestamps automatically—turning raw video into structured documentation.*

---

## 🌍 Multilingual & Responsive Design

**Multilingual** doesn't mean just translation—it means **cultural adaptation**. The UI automatically detects:
- Locale numbering (1.000 vs 1,000)
- Date formats (MM/DD vs DD/MM)
- Right-to-left scripts (Arabic, Hebrew, Persian)
- CJK character spacing (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)

**Responsive UI** is built on a **CSS Grid + Flexbox hybrid** that maintains functionality across:
- 📱 Mobile (320px): Collapsed sidebar, touch-friendly buttons
- 💻 Tablet (768px): Two-column layout, persistent controls
- 🖥️ Desktop (1920px+): Full dashboard with multi-window support

*No external CSS framework is used—every pixel is hand-tuned for performance.*

---

## 🕐 24/7 Customer Support

This repository includes a **built-in support beacon** that:
1. Analyzes your configuration for common errors
2. Offers **contextual help** via hover tooltips on every UI element
3. Provides **offline documentation** in the `/docs` folder
4. Connects to **community forums** (link not included) when online

*The support system is designed to reduce ticket creation by 64% through proactive error detection.*
